        <h3>I am Samarth. I have a friend whose name is Anirudh and he love Minecraft.<br> i have heard recently that only noobs like mineraft and great people like Samarth do not. is this true. well there is no need of evidence to prove Anirudh is a noob
            but its pretty intuitive that Anirudh is. Minecraft looks just like this <br>

        <h4> Well the aim of this file is to prove anirudh that i also know html and currently i am also trying to prove that anirudh is a noob although there is no need of pratical or logical proof for that<br> i am also sure Airudh would respond to this
            and would also create a new page/file to make fun of me.<br> Anirud I am waiting, make an page fast. <br>For now bye and have a great day!!!</h4>
